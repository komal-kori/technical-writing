# technical-writing
This repository showcases my technical writing skills and documentation practices for hardware and semiconductor-adjacent environments.

## What you’ll find here
- **IP Summaries**: engineer-friendly one-pagers describing hardware blocks and interfaces
- **Design Specs**: requirements, assumptions, and acceptance criteria
- **User Manuals**: structured guides for setup, bring-up, and operations
- **Release Notes**: versioned changes, known issues, and upgrade notes
- **API Reference**: clear endpoint/interface documentation
- **Runbooks**: operational procedures and troubleshooting workflows

## Important note on confidentiality
All documents in this repository are **original, anonymized samples** created to demonstrate my documentation approach.
They do **not** contain proprietary content from any of my employers and use generic names and representative examples.

## Documentation toolchain
- Markdown-first workflow suitable for GitHub/GitLab
- PR-style review approach (structure, accuracy, and usability)
- Metadata/taxonomy concepts to improve retrieval and discoverability
